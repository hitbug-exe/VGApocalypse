# VGApocalypse

*Apocalypse has come and gone*

*We are just grabbing in the ashes*

VGApocalypse is a basic VGA driver and printf implementation written in C, perfect for your apocalypse plan (not that we're anticipating an actual apocalypse, but hey, it never hurts to be prepared).

# How to build VGApocalypse?

To build VGApocalypse, simply run the following command:

  `gcc -c ports.h screen.h kernel.c ports.c screen.c -o kernel.o`

This will compile kernel.c into an object file kernel.o, which you can then link with your C program.

# Disclaimer

Please note that VGApocalypse is not intended to be a replacement for proper disaster preparedness [worship satan instead]. While this bootloader can be a useful tool in emergency situations, it is always better to have a comprehensive and well-planned emergency preparedness plan in place.

# Who Created VGApocalypse?

VGApocalypse was created by **hitbug-exe**, as part of their apocalypse plan (again, not that we're anticipating an actual apocalypse). If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for improvement, feel free to get in touch!
